# December 2023 Newsletter

2023-12-01

## Compiler Updates [#](#compiler-updates)

Only minor fixes and additions to the core library.
[Monthly Release](https://github.com/odin-lang/Odin/releases/tag/dev-2023-12)

---

## YouTube [#](#youtube)

As always [Karl Zylinski](https://www.youtube.com/@karl_zylinski) and [Rickard Andersson](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VLcTrUhSdlg&list=PLEQTpgQ9eFCGlQa2z0j_TQTGggHOIF8Z1) are continuously uploading content on Odin. Great to see people using & sharing it!

---

## Events [#](#events)

[Handmade Seattle](https://handmadecities.com/media/) happened two weeks ago! Bill had a chat with Abner Coimbre, the organizer of Handmade Seattle.

## Orca [#](#orca)

Handmade Seattle hosted multiple amazing demos. There was one which I needed to mention is [Orca](https://orca-app.dev/) by *Martin Fouilleul*.

WebAssembly apps without the web.  
A brand-new stack for cross-platform apps.

There was also Q&A session afterwards [here](https://vimeo.com/889290402/33706f0dbf)

### Orca & Odin [#](#orca--odin)

As Orca only requires developers to export a `.wasm` module, writing Orca applications is a straightforward process! Naturally, Odin supports this feature, as demonstrated with [wasm4](https://wasm4.org/).

Here are the first few sample demos converted from C to Odin, utilizing the C bindings. While it’s functional, there are still a few details we need to iron out for smoother out-of-the-box performance. We hope to have everyone try it out this December.

I’m genuinely excited about Orca and eager to see its development path!
